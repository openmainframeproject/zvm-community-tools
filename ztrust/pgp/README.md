# ztrust/pgp

This is the ztrust/pgp folder
with various PGP keys of members of the z/VM and z/Linux community.

## Signing

PGP keys found here contain signatures which may extend into the larger
Web of Trust. In any case, signatures on these keys serve to assure
their ownership and veracity.

## Naming

An example naming convention is ...

    key ID (16 hex digits) "-" email address "-public.asc"

This makes them easy to find based on email address
but also allows them to be sorted by long form key ID.

Most keys here have a file type extension of `.asc`
indicating that they are ASCII-armored.
