# ztrust

This is the ztrust folder
which serves as a trust anchor for the z/VM and z/Linux community.

## PGP keys

The `pgp` sub-directory has a number of PGP keys
contributed by members of the community. It forms a web-of-trust.

## PKI certificates

The `pki` sub-directory has a number of PKI root certificates
contributed by members of the community. Some of these are signed
using PGP.


## Multiplicity

This sub-directory exists in two repositories:

https://github.com/openmainframeproject/zvm-community-tools/tree/main/ztrust

https://github.com/trothr/vmworkshop/tree/master/ztrust

Eventually we hope to include keys and certs from the larger mainframe community.
