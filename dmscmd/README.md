# DMSCMD
DMSCMD does this ...

## Building DMSCMD
To build ``DMSCMD``, perform the following steps:
- Download it and copy it to your A disk as text (ASCII).  
- Rename it to EXEC: 
```
==> rename dmscmd mailable a = exec =
```
- Do this (perhaps split these out to describe each step?):
```
==> vmfhlasm dmscmd dmsvm
==> load dmscmd (origin trans
==> genmod dmscmd
```

## Using DMSCMD
To use ``DMSCMD``, perform the following steps:

```
==> dmscmd <history n>
```

There is no limit on <n> because memory will limit it long before anything else.
