# CMS TAR

Copyright 1995, Richard M. Troth, all rights reserved.

This is the README file for CMS TAR 2.3 in plain text. There are some much needed enhancements to the translation (or not) selection logic that I had hoped to get in before the '96 Workshop, but time just seems to fly away.

Copyright 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 Richard M. Troth. This software may be freely distributed as long as copyright notice and header remain intact. There is no charge, although a substantial amount of personal time went into this effort.

CMS TAR version 2 is a from-scratch 'tar' creator/extractor built upon the powerful CMS Pipelines. Files archived with CMS TAR version 2 can be extracted UNIX 'tar' and files archived with UNIX 'tar' can be extracted with CMS TAR.

There also exists Rice CMS TAR version 1, which is C sourced and was written by Sean Starke. CMS TAR 1.0 is based on GNU TAR. This is NOT the same program or package. (although I have borrowed and modified Sean's HELP file) Changes to GNU TAR for CMS were returned to the Free Software Foundation. Extent of use or incorporation of those changes in the distribution GNU TAR package is unknown. Rice University DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE. Don't ask them.

Also included is a TARLIST EXEC. This tool allows you to "browse" a TAR archive and selectively view or extract files. It is NOT as functional as CMS FILELIST, which inspired it. Maybe more later.
