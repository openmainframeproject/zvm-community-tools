SPBACKUP reports a premature end. Please check its logs in SYSLOG and in        
its reader to be sure it ran OK.                                                
                                                                                
We are going to attempt to run the WRAPUP step, however it might not            
work. It may be necessary to run the WRAPUP step over again after               
figuring out why the job failed.
