0      ISARC consists of several modules, all of which form the re-
       quest component.  Each module, for the most part, has a sep-
       arate  and  distinct  function.    The  modules  and   their
       functions are detailed below.

                 the ISARCHLP module.  ISARCHLP execution is called
                 separately  by any other module which needs use of
                 the online help display.
 
       ISARCHLP  The online help display module.  This module  for-

                 "branch out" of the request component by executing
                 CMS commands.

       ISARCINS  This module serves as a step between the main menu
+      ISARCINS
+      ISARCINS
+      ISARCINS
                 and  the  actual  account  request  screen.    In-

                 and presented in a manner suitable to a restricted
                 environment.
 
       ISARCMNU  The main menu.  This module presents the  customer

                 and upon the valid input of the SSN, the result is
                 returned for processing.

                 results file (MESSAGE MASTER), and  results  found
                 (if any) are displayed.
 
       ISARCREQ  This  module is step one of two of the account re-
+      ISARCREQ

                 Touch-Tone Registration PIN belonging to the  cus-
                 tomer.   The results are then returned for further
                 processing.

0      After modifying one or more of the components of  ISARC  (or
       even  some of the support/text files associated with ISARC),
       it will be necessary to "re-make" ISARC for  public  access.
       To  do so, make sure the account being used for this purpose
       has about 5M of virtual storage available (the REXX compiler
       will need this).  Then make sure that the SFS directory con-
       taining the ISARC code and  files  is  accessed.    At  that
       point,  execute  the  exec named "MAKISARC".   The exec will
       proceed to compile each of the ISARC modules  into  compiled
       REXX.    If return codes of 0 and/or 4 are returned from all
       of the module compilations (where a return code of  4  indi-
       cates  that the REXX TRACE command is not supported for com-
       pilation), then the make exec  will  continuing  processing.
       If  at least one of the module compilations did not give the
       proper return code, then  all  further  make  processing  is
       halted.
 
       Given  that  the  module  compilations  returned  the proper
       codes, the make exec continues by first discarding the LIST-
       ING files (resulting from the compilations).    After  that,
       all  old  code  and files are removed from the public access
       directory (VMSYS:VMSERV01.ISARC.PUBLIC_ACCESS), and all  new
       code and files are moved to the public access directory.  As
       a  final  step,  PUBLIC access read authority is granted for
       each file in the public access directory.    It  is  assumed
       that  the public access directory has already had the proper
       authorizations applied to it (i.e., the READ and NEWREAD au-
       thorities have been granted for PUBLIC).  If not, this  must
       be done before public customers will have access to ISARC.
 
       If testing is to be done on the new code or files, please be
       aware of the following restrictions/requirements:
 
       1.  The  account  must  be  able  to  transmit  data  to the
           VMSERV01 service  machine  via  the  CP  SMSG  facility.
           Without  this  ability, the account request service will
           fail and the query status service will be somewhat  lim-
           ited  (those  messages  needing userids will be replaced
 
1      Page 5
 
0          with messages without userids, as userids  are  obtained
           from the VMSERV01 service machine).
 
       2.  The  account  must  at least have read access to the 491
           minidisk owned by VMSERV02.   This access is  needed  to
           obtain  the  results  of  account  creation  processing.
           Without access to the VMSERV02 491 minidisk,  the  query
           status  and  account  request  services will be made not
           available.
 
       3.  In order to test menu item disables  and/or  maintenance
           shutdown features, the account used for testing (or some
           other  account)  must  have read/write access to the SFS
           directory VMSYS:VMSERV01.ISARC.PUBLIC_ACCESS  (owned  by
           VMSERV01).  This access is needed to write/copy the nec-
           essary            disabler            files           to
           VMSYS:VMSERV01.ISARC.PUBLIC_ACCESS.

0      If the need arises to disable some part or parts or  all  of
       ISARC,  then  the  capability  does  exist.   Depending upon
       whether you want to disable  a  certain  part  or  parts  of
       ISARC,  or  whether  you  want to shutdown all of ISARC, you
       must determine which files must be placed in the SFS  direc-
       tory VMSYS:VMSERV01.ISARC.PUBLIC_ACCESS.  To determine which
       file      or      files      must      be      placed     in
       VMSYS:VMSERV01.ISARC.PUBLIC_ACCESS, see below.

                           vices are unavailable.
 
       In addition, note that the contents of the file is  not  im-
       portant,  only  that  the  file  exists  with  the specified
       filename and filetype on the required minidisk.    The  menu
       item  disabler  files  may  be mixed together, i.e., you may
 
1      Page 6
 
0      disable more than one of the menu items.  However, disabling
       all three of the menu items (with the existence of the three
       menu item disabler files) will be considered  by  ISARC  the
       same  as declaring a maintenance mode.  Therefore, a mainte-
       nance mode can be declared by creating all three of the menu
       item disabler files or by creating only the $MAINT  $DISABLE
       file.   However, the intended method for declaring a mainte-
       nance mode was to create the $MAINT $DISABLE file.
 
       When a menu item is disabled via presence  of  a  menu  item
       disabler  file,  the customer will see the words "NOT AVAIL-
       ABLE" highlighted and beside the menu item.    The  customer
       will  not  be able to select the menu item.  However, please
       note that there are some limitations as  to  when  the  menu
       item  is disabled or when ISARC is declared as under mainte-
       nance within each account that is executing the ISARC  code.
       Menu  item  disables and/or the maintenance mode declaration
       is only recognized when the main menu  module  has  control.
       If  a  customer  is  viewing about information, querying the
       status of an account, or requesting  an  account,  then  the
       customer  will  be able to complete (depending upon the cir-
       cumstances) the action they are performing.   Once the  cus-
       tomer  returns to the main menu, the disables or maintenance
       mode will take effect.
 
       However, if the customer is on the main menu and attempts to
       select a menu item which has been disabled (but does not yet
       show it on the screen), the customer will still not be  able
       to  select  the  menu  item.   The main menu module performs
       availability checks prior to display or  re-display  of  the
       menu screen.

                 file will override this error  condition  so  that

                 go through the  list  of  conditions  which  could
                 auto-disable  a menu item, and eliminate each con-

                 Without  the  presence  of VMSERV01 on the system,

                 disabled,  and  the  query  status  menu item will
                 still be functional.   However, the  query  status
                 menu item will switch over to messages that do not
                 display  userids,  as  userids  are not obtainable
                 without the VMSERV01 service machine.  Consult the
                 necessary support personnel as to why VMSERV01  is
                 not logged onto the system.  If there is no reason
                 for VMSERV01 to be logged off, restarting VMSERV01
                 will  re-enable the account request menu item, and

                 count requests services  will  be  available,  but
                 will fail when the actual account request is to be
                 sent to VMSERV01.  Query status services will also
                 be  affected; however, messages containing userids
                 will be replaced with  messages  without  userids.
                 Consult  the necessary support personnel as to why

                 20 seconds apart.   If all  three  attempts  fail,
                 this  message  is displayed.  The problem could be
                 transitory (system load, VMSERV01 extremely  busy,
                 etc.);  however,  it may be worth the while to en-
                 sure  that  VMSERV01  is  up  and  running,   that
                 VMSERV01  has not hung for some reason or another,
                 and the like.  If the problem continues,  customer
                 service will become seriously degraded.

0      Below  are the currently defined critical messages and codes
       for the Individual Student Account Request (ISAR) component.
       The best plan of action for any of these messages and  codes
       is  to  obtain as much information as possible from the cus-
       tomer when any of these conditions are  reported.    Try  to
       find  out what they were doing (requesting, querying status,
       etc.), what they entered or did to cause the condition,  and
       any  other  information  which  the customer can offer which
       might assist support personnel in determining and  resolving
       the problem.  Also please be aware that some of the messages
       may  give  "debugging"  information,  such  as  message code
       RST004.  Obtaining this information can be very important.
 
       There are currently 4 condition  states:    PLANNED,  ERROR,
       POSSIBLY  SEVERE,  and  SEVERE  (in  order of severity, from
       least to greatest).  PLANNED conditions do not  need  to  be

0      reported on unless they are suspect in some way.  ERROR con-
       ditions  do  not really require immediate contact of support
       personnel, but the condition should be resolved as  soon  as
       possible.   POSSIBLY SEVERE conditions are termed "possibly"
       because they may be severe, but the experienced problem  may
       also  be a transitory effect (e.g., system load and response
       time).   For POSSIBLY SEVERE  conditions,  the  problem  may
       clear  up  on its own, but if the problem does not alleviate
       itself in a relatively short time frame, report  the  condi-
       tion  immediately to support personnel.  Finally, the SEVERE
       condition is the worst case, and must be reported to support
       personnel immediately.  SEVERE conditions most  often  indi-
       cate  that  most or all of the ISAR component (or some other
       process) is down.
